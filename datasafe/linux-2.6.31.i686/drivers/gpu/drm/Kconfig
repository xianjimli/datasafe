	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support.

	  GPU memory management subsystem for devices with multiple
	  GPU memory types. Will be enabled automatically if a device driver
	  uses it.

	depends on DRM && PCI
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a 3dfx Banshee or Voodoo3 (or later),
	  graphics card.  If M is selected, the module will be called tdfx.

config DRM_R128

	depends on DRM && PCI
	select FW_LOADER
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Rage 128 graphics card.  If M
	  is selected, the module will be called r128.  AGP support for
	  this card is strongly suggested (unless you have a PCI version).

	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Radeon graphics card.  There
	  are both PCI and AGP versions.  You don't need to choose this to
	  run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.

	  If M is selected, the module will be called radeon.

config DRM_I810

	help
	  Choose this option if you have an Intel I810 graphics card.  If M is
	  selected, the module will be called i810.  AGP support is required
	  for this driver to work.

	  module will be called i830.  AGP support is required for this driver
	  to work. This driver is used by the older X releases X.org 6.7 and
	  XFree86 4.3. If unsure, build this and i915 as modules and the X server
	  will load the correct one.

	  the X server will load the correct one.

config DRM_I915_KMS
	bool "Enable modesetting on intel by default"
	depends on DRM_I915
	help
	  Choose this option if you want kernel modesetting enabled by default,
	  and you have a new enough userspace to support this. Running old
	  userspaces with this enabled will cause pain.  Note that this causes
	  the driver to bind to PCI devices, which precludes loading things
	  like intelfb.
